grc beta status

grc is currently in beta.

The core language and execution semantics are stable, but some features are
intentionally incomplete or still being hardened.

What works reliably
- Interactive REPL with history
- External programs, pipelines, and redirections
- Background jobs and jobs/fg/bg
- rc-style expansion and functions
- Assignments (standalone and prefix)
- Control flow: if/for/while/switch
- $status and $apid

Known limitations
- Full-screen job control (vim/less) is still being tuned in some environments
- Pipelines involving builtins or functions have best-effort job control
- Here documents and ${} expansion are not implemented
- fd duplication redirections are parsed but not yet executed
- exec, wait, shift, ., ~ are not implemented
- Quoting/escaping behavior is still being tightened

Safety notes
- Do not run grc as root
- Signal handling and job control are implemented conservatively
- Scripts written for grc should not assume POSIX shell behavior

Versioning
Breaking changes may occur until v1.0.0
