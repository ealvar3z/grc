GRC

Warning: this is a beta shell intended for rc-style scripting and interactive use.
Do not run as root.

This repository is a minimal Go module for a shell-like parser. It contains a
small lexer and a goyacc-based grammar that builds a lightweight AST. The
parser is intentionally minimal and focuses on structure rather than rc
semantics.

Layout:
- cmd/grc: CLI that reads stdin and attempts to parse it.
- internal/parse: AST, lexer, parser grammar, generated parser, and tests.
- upstream: reference copies of the upstream grammar and generated parser.

Notes:
- The lexer recognizes basic operators, words, and single-quoted strings.
- The AST records operator structure and word order, not full evaluation rules.
- To run tests in this environment, use an absolute GOCACHE path, for example:
  GOCACHE=/home/eax/repos/grc/.gocache go test ./...
